# LLM Chat Exporter

## üöÄ Project Overview

**LLM Chat Exporter** is an open-source web application that solves a critical problem for AI users: the difficulty of extracting, archiving, and sharing conversations from popular Large Language Model platforms in high-quality, professional formats.

## üéØ The Problem

Current challenges with LLM chat sharing and archiving:

1. **Selection Difficulty**: Nearly impossible to select all text from lengthy conversations
2. **Artifact Management**: Code snippets, files, and other artifacts are scattered and hard to collect
3. **Poor PDF Quality**: Browser-based PDF saves result in low-quality, often single-page documents
4. **Format Limitations**: No standardized way to export conversations in structured formats
5. **Manual Process**: Time-consuming manual copy-paste workflows for important conversations

## üí° The Solution

A single-page web application that accepts shared chat links from major LLM platforms and converts them into professional, high-quality documents in multiple formats:

### Supported Platforms
- **ChatGPT** (chatgpt.com/share/*)
- **Claude** (claude.ai/share/*)  
- **Gemini** (gemini.google.com/share/*)
- **Perplexity** (perplexity.ai/search/*)

### Export Formats
- **PDF** - Professional layout with proper formatting
- **Markdown** - Developer-friendly with preserved code blocks
- **JSON** - Structured data for programmatic use
- **CSV** - Tabular format for analysis
- **Text** - Clean, readable plain text

## üåü Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **One-Click Export**: Simply paste a shared link and select your format
- **Multi-Format Support**: Five different export formats to suit various needs
- **Artifact Preservation**: Properly handles code blocks, images, and other rich content
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse and automated attacks

### User Experience
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, professional interface with modern animations
- **Progressive Implementation**: Starting with ChatGPT, then expanding to other platforms
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Preview**: See your export before downloading

### Open Source
- **MIT License**: Fully open source for community contributions
- **High Code Quality**: Professional standards suitable for enterprise use
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed setup and contribution guides

## üé® Design Philosophy

**Professional Minimalism**: The interface embodies the principle that great design is invisible. Users should focus on their content, not the tool.

**Performance First**: Fast loading, instant processing, and smooth interactions are non-negotiable.

**Accessibility**: Built with universal design principles to serve all users effectively.

## üöÄ Market Opportunity

### Current Market Gaps
- Existing solutions are browser extensions with limited functionality
- No comprehensive multi-platform solution exists
- Enterprise users need professional-quality exports for documentation

### Target Users
- **AI Researchers**: Need to archive and share research conversations
- **Content Creators**: Want to repurpose AI conversations into blog posts, tutorials
- **Enterprise Teams**: Require documentation of AI-assisted decision making
- **Educators**: Need to share AI conversations with students
- **General Users**: Want to preserve important conversations

## üîÆ Vision

To become the standard tool for AI conversation archival and sharing, enabling a new ecosystem of AI-powered content creation and knowledge management.
